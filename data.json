The SP uses the information to his benefits and gives the file to the CM in return for a much earlier promised transfer to Delhi. Pammi is determined to find out about baba\u2019s truth and so she pretends to be intoxicated and unconscious. At the same time, Pammi\u2019s father is on his way to meet her when he meets with an accident. Will Pammi be able to voice out the truth of baba? Will the CM expose Baba Nirala and his ashram?",
